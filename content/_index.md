These World War II letters from my Dad, Hugh Heffron Lavery, to his future wife are most likely of interest because of their rather detailed descriptions of Okinawa and of Army life in general.  

I composed an earlier blog about my Mom's relatives titled [Gladys Potter's Family](http://hlavery.org) which can provide further background information.  

Much of my inspiration for making these letters available online was reading the [Moss family letters](https://www.mossletters.com) which covers some of the same territory in terms of conditions on Okinawa towards the end of the war.  Mr. Moss's war experience was far longer and involve some brutal action pre-Okinawa.  Highly recommended!

There are, however, few collections of similar letters on-line.  This is just one more set to add.
