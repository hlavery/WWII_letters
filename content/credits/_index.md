This website was created using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io),
a static site generator that process Markdown text into HTML, avoiding
the complexities of that language.

Hugo requires a "theme," and I chose [DocDock](https://docdock.vjeantet.fr).
DocDoc is usually used for software documentation, but I found it very 
effective for organizing scanned letters and photos.

The final build is done on [Fleek](https://fleek.co).
