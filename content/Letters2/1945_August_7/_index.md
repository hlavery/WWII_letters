The house-like structures are also *Haka*-style tombs.  The wartime use of these tombs by the Okinawans is movingly told in the novella "Turtleback Tombs" by Oshiro Tatsuhiro (1966) available in translation in "Southern Exposure - Modern Japanese Literature from Okinawa (Molasky and Rabson, 2000)*|
