 {{% alert theme="info" %}}Dad's ship has finally arrived at its destination (Okinawa, as we know now). We can be reasonably certain that Mary did not fly to her leave destination, as she saw far too many training flight crashes in Pensacols NAS, took them rather personally and never-ever flew anywhere. V-E day was Tuesday, May 8, 1945, back when Dad's ship was nowhere in particular.) {{% /alert %}}
 {{% alert theme="success" %}}The poem which puzzled Dad was a typing school exercise which later also came my way.."Mary had an airplane/and through the air did frisk/wasn't she a silly thing/her little *) which doesn't work in handwriting.  I suppose Mary's letter was typed. {{% /alert %}}
